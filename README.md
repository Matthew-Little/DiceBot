# Welcome to my updated Discord bot "Dice Bot"!
This is an update to the original [DiscordBot](https://github.com/Matthew-Little/DiscordBot) using a more modern version (v14) of the discord.js package and Typescript.

## What is DiceBot?
"Dice Bot" is a discord bot created to assist me in managing any of the discord servers I administrate as well as to assist me in running table top games that require dice (i.e. Tabletop Role Playing Games such as Dungeons and Dragons) using discord as a medium for connecting with the players.
